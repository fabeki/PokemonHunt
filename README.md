Pokemon Hunt is a small JavaScript treasure hunt game. Where the player has to collect the pokemons before Meowth catches him. The collected pokemons will be displayed (colored pokeball) right below the gameboard.

This game is made for my final exercise for the module JavaScript, during my full stack development training.
